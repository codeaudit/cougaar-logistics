  The TPFDD Viewer is a GUI that displays time-phased force deployment data.
 &nbsp;Basically, this is <br>
  what-when-how-whom information (why is implicit). &nbsp;That is, the viewer
 shows what cargo is being transported,<br>
  when it departs and when it arrives, how it gets to its destination (on 
what conveyance), and who owns the <br>
  cargo. &nbsp;The viewer displays this information, enables the user to
filter  and sort this information, and view<br>
  this information from the point of view of the cargo or the conveyances 
that transport the cargo.    The user's guide to the datagrabber and TPFDD
Viewer is <a href="DataGrabber-UsersGuide.html">  here</a>

<h2><a name="Runs"></a>
  Runs</h2>
  Every run that the datagrabber has collected is presented in the Run Menu
 at the top of the display. Each<br>
   run shows the number and time of the run. &nbsp;The run status (W - warning,
 OK - no warnings) is presented,<br>
   along with an indicator for which run is currently being displayed. &nbsp;This
 is consistent with the textual status <br>
   information on the right upper side of the main display.  
<h2><a name="GUI_Screens"></a>
  GUI Screens</h2>
  The viewer presents a number of basic screens : the <b>Log Plan View</b>
 , the <b>Asset Usage View</b>, <br>
   the <b>Run Statistics Tab</b>, the <b>Run Charts Tab</b>, and the <b>Filter
 Dialog</b>.  
<h3><a name="Log_Plan_View"></a>
  Log Plan View</h3>
  The Log Plan View presents the hierarchy of organizations, with rolled-up
 itinerary information <br>
  presented for each unit or higher-level organization. &nbsp;The user can
 drill down into this information until the unit level is reached. There,<br>
  the user can choose to see the unit equipment either <b>by cargo</b> or 
<b> by carrier</b>. &nbsp;  
<h4><a name="By_Cargo"></a>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Cargo</h4>
  The <b>by cargo</b> option shows a list of the types of cargo that this 
unit owns. &nbsp;Drilling down into a cargo type, the <br>
  list of actual cargo items is presented.<br>
  Drilling down to the final level shows each leg of the journey, with the
 width<br>
    of a lozenge indicating the leg's time duration. &nbsp;Each row also
shows  <b>from </b>and <b>to </b>information for the cargo<br>
  item or a leg of the journey, depending on the level of detail.  
<h4><a name="By_Carrier"></a>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Carrier</h4>
  The by carrier option shows a list of the types of carrier (or conveyances)
 that were used to transport the unit equipment.<br>
  Drilling down further, the list of actual carriers of the type is shown.
 If the type name is colored <b>yellow</b>, it means that the<br>
  equipment is <b>self-transportable</b>, that is, it's a truck or other
conveyance  that transports itself and is not moved on land by <br>
  another conveyance. Drilling down to the next level, a list of cargo types<br>
  carried by the conveyance is shown. &nbsp;At this point, the display is 
like the <b>by cargo</b> display, showing the items carried.  
<h4><a name="Right_Click_Options"></a>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right Click Options</h4>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any row of the Log Plan View,
you  can right click, and you will be presented with a menu that allows the<br>
  user to choose from a number of other displays. &nbsp;The choices are : 
  
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New TPFDD for XXX </h4>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where XXX is item
 being selected. &nbsp;XXX can be as large as a unit or as small as an individual
 item of cargo. &nbsp;<br>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Filter</h4>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings up 
a filter dialog, allowing the user to sort through the transportation information<br>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carrier Use (only in a carrier
context)</h4>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the item selected
 is a carrier, it will show a TPFDD-like display that shows the use of the
 carrier or carrier<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type over the course of the whole move.<br>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display Route (only in a cargo
or carrier context)</h4>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Displays on a
map  the route the cargo item or carrier follows.<br>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display Details (only in a cargo
 or carrier item context)</h4>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Displays other 
details about the carrier or cargo, depending on context. &nbsp;Included is
information about dimensions, ownership, etc.  
<h4><a name="Colors"></a>
  Colors</h4>
  The colors in the Log Plan View indicate what mode the cargo went by :
air  (blue), sea (green), or ground (yellow), <br>
  or some combination (purple).<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="TPFDD_Display"></a>
  TPFDD Display</h3>
  The TPFDD display has rows for each item, where each row shows a sequence
 of symbols that represent the <br>
  stages of the journey the cargo takes. The width of each lozenge or symbol
 indicates the amount of time taken <br>
  on that leg. &nbsp;The color coding indicates what mode the cargo item
went  by : green for sea, yellow for ground, blue<br>
  for air. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
  Mousing over each lozenge item, a textual description appears on the status
 line below. &nbsp;This presents in English<br>
  the meaning of the lozenge. &nbsp;For instance, mousing over the first
lozenge  item may show something like :<br>
<br>
<b>Origin : FT_STEWART departs at 9/12/01 10:52</b><br>
<br>
  This indicates the origin of the item being moved is Fort Stewart, Georgia
 and the date of its departure.<br>
<br>
  The dialog allows the user to zoom in or zoom out, or to display more or
 fewer rows in the dialog at any one time.<br>
  By dragging the date numbers in blue at the top, the user can look at different
 time windows. <br>
<br>
  As the user zooms in or out, more or less textual information is displayed
 in the lozenges, depending on how much<br>
  can fit inside the lozenge. 
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Status_Line"></a>
Status Line</h4>
 Below the dialog controls and above the TPFDD lines is a status line that 
gives four pieces of information about the TPFDD:<br>
 1) Total number of items in TPFDD<br>
2) Total tonnage (short tons)<br>
3) Total volume (cubic meters)<br>
4) The time it took to create the TPFDD.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;An example is :<br>

<br>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Export_menu"></a>
Export menu</h4>
TPFDD data can be exported to a CSV (comma separated values) file that's
convenient to manipulate in Excel. &nbsp;There<br>
are two options : <b>Export CSV file</b> and <b>Export Sea Legs CSV file</b>
. &nbsp;The Sea Legs option filters the TPFDD data so that only<br>
sea legs are sent to the CSV file. &nbsp;When a menu item is selected, a
save dialog appears asking for the name of the file to save to.<br>
<br>
The output looks like:<br>

<h3><a name="Filtering"></a>
  Filtering</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TPFDD Filter Dialog</h4>
  The TPFDD Filter Dialog allows you to select a unit or some set of units
 and filter by carrier type or instance and/or<br>
  cargo type or instance. &nbsp;The results can then be rolled up by cargo
 type, or by unit and then by cargo type.<br>
<br>
  On the left side is the unit hierarchy. Once a unit or units is selected,
 you can then click Get Manifest Info to fill in<br>
  the list boxes on the right. &nbsp;These are then populated with the types
 of carriers and the actual carriers used for<br>
  the selected units, and the cargo types and cargo instances that belong 
to the selected units. &nbsp;At any time the user<br>
  can click the Display TPFDD button to view a TPFDD display. &nbsp;The Aggregate
 TPFDD button brings up a TPFDD-like<br>
  display where each row presents an aggregate row for all instances of the
 type. &nbsp;The Unit Aggregate button breaks<br>
  this information down first by unit and then by cargo type.<br>
<br>
  For instance, this dialog allows the user to ask which ship carried the 
tanks of the 3-69-ARBN battalion. <br>
  Or more specifically, which ship carried a specific tank, or which items
 were on a specific ship. <br>
<br>
  On the left side, once a unit is selected, clicking the Select Subordinates
 button will select all subordinates of the unit. The<br>
  check boxes on the upper right control which criteria, carrier and/or cargo
 filtering is to be used.<br>
<br>
  The Sort By Name check box controls whether the TPFDD generated is sorted
 by time or by cargo name.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Asset_Usage_View"></a>
  Asset Usage View</h3>
  The Asset Usage View shows the use of assets over the course of the whole
 move. &nbsp;This display is from the point of <br>
  view of the carrier. &nbsp;The carrier assets are broken down by type --
 sea, air, land, land (self-propelled), and misc. &nbsp;Within<br>
  each category, they are further broken down by carrier type. For instance,
 within air, there are 747s, C-17s, etc. &nbsp;These are<br>
  then broken down by where the assets are based or what organization owns
 them. Drilling down further, there are rows for <br>
  each individual asset. &nbsp;Below this level, there is a row for each
mission  undertaken by the asset. &nbsp;And below this level, there<br>
  is a row for each leg of the mission. &nbsp;Here too, one can right click
 and see details about the carrier, including a TPFDD view<br>
  to see what items are carried on the asset over the course of the whole 
move.  
<h3><a name="Run_Statistics"></a>
  Run Statistics</h3>
  The run statistics tab allows the user to ask very specific questions about
 the data. &nbsp;For instance, the user can ask how many items<br>
  were shipped for per unit. Other options include presenting the cargo dimensions
 for all cargo types, or arrival time precision per unit<br>
  (this shows how close to the requested arrival time cargo items were actually
 scheduled).  
<h3><a name="Run_Charts"></a>
  Run Charts</h3>
  This option presents the statistics information in chart form.<br>
