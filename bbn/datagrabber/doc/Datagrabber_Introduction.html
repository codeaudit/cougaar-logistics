 The Datagrabber is a tool to aggregate data about allocations to physical
assets (typically transportation tasks).<br>
These data are stored in a database. &nbsp;Once stored, the data can be visualized
with the <a href="file:///D:/datagrabber/doc/TPFDDViewer-Introduction.html">
TPFDD Viewer</a>
.<br>
The datagrabber combines a number of components, including specialized PSPs,
a work-queue engine, a web-server,<br>
a logger, and a validation system to become a complete system for capturing
the results of a society run.<br>
<br>

<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>
Introduction</h3>
<br>
The Datagrabber assumes that there is a demand society producing tasks (typically
transportation tasks) and a <br>
servicing society that satisfies these tasks. &nbsp;These two societies may
be the same, as in the case of in-theater transportation,<br>
or different, in the case of strategic transportation. &nbsp;When a run is
initiated, the datagrabber asks both the demand society<br>
and the servicing society for its hierarchy of agents. &nbsp;This provides
the organizational framework that the TPFDD Viewer<br>
needs to display a hierarchy of units and their equipment.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Web_Server"></a>
Web Server</h3>
The datagrabber supports a simple web server that provides the GUI for interaction
with the datagrabber. &nbsp;This web server<br>
presents the basic services that are accessible:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h4><a name="AVAILABLE_RUNS"></a>
AVAILABLE RUNS </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View current and previously available runs done by the
data gatherer. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Here's a sample run line:<br>
<br>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="Top"><b>ID<br>
      </b></td>
      <td valign="Top"><b>&nbsp;Start Time<br>
      </b></td>
      <td valign="Top"><b>End Time<br>
      </b></td>
      <td valign="Top"><b> Status<br>
      </b></td>
      <td valign="Top"><b> Action</b><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="Top">1<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="Top">2001-11-01 23:30:00<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="Top">2001-11-01 23:31:15<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="Top"><b>Completed</b>: Run inactive<b><br>
      </b></td>
      <td valign="Top"><b>Validation</b>, <b>Delete</b><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The start time and end time record when the datagrabber
run started and ended. &nbsp;<br>
The Status section shows the status : clicking on the Completed link takes
you to a listing of the log messages for the run. &nbsp;<br>
The Action section shows the options available for the run : you can either
run validation tests or delete the run by clicking on these links.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this view you can click on Show Disk Space to see the
amount of space needed to store a particular run.<br>
<h4><a name="COMPLETION_ASSESSOR"></a>
COMPLETION ASSESSOR </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View the completion status of the current COUGAAR society,
if one is running.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This page lets you monitor the progress of the servicing
society, and when are you ready to start a new run, you can start one from
this page.<br>
<h4><a name="ACTIVE_WORK"></a>
ACTIVE WORK </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List active work that is currently being done by the data
gatherer.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a run is started, this page will show the low-level
steps the datagrabber does that make up the sampling activity.<br>
<h4><a name="LOGS"></a>
LOGS </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List data gatherer logs for each previous run.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a complete list of logs. &nbsp;You can choose
the detail level of the logging by clicking on the links at the top.<br>
<h4><a name="VALIDATION"></a>
VALIDATION </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View and run validation tests that assess the correctness
of previous society runs.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the actions change to the ability to run or view
either just the core tests or the entire set of validation tests.<br>
<h4><a name="COMPARISON"></a>
COMPARISON </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View and run comparisons between validation tests of different
runs.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the section on run Comparisons. &nbsp;Here there is
the additional option of indicating one run as the baseline and then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using it to compare against the other runs. &nbsp;The
actions change to run or displaying just the core diffs or all the diffs.
<br>
<h4><a name="DERIVED_TABLES"></a>
DERIVED TABLES </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generate derived tables that enhance TPFDD performance.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
These pages are available from any page via a list of links at the bottom
of every page.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3><a name="Validation_Tests"></a>
Validation Tests</h3>
There are a range of tests that can be applied to any run. &nbsp;These are
broken down into four categories : Core tests, Info, Warning,<br>
and Error. &nbsp;
<h4><a name="Core_Tests"></a>
Core Tests</h4>
The Core tests are four tests that are meant to be the basis for comparing
one run to another to see if the two are<br>
effectively equivalent. &nbsp;Since there can be small, insignificant, variations
in arrival time of an item from one run to another, <br>
statistical measures are used to compare arrival times. &nbsp;See the section
on run comparisons.
<h4><a name="Info_Tests"></a>
Info Tests</h4>
These provide in depth statistics about the run, including items like the
number of people and number of cargo transported.<br>
The tests are also accessible from the TPFDD Viewer. &nbsp;The results are
shared, so that if the datagrabber runs an info test,<br>
it will be immediately accessible from the TPFDD Viewer.<br>
<h4><a name="Warning_Tests"></a>
Warning Tests</h4>
These tests show possible problems in the run. &nbsp;For instance, they compare
the density of every demand side item to that of<br>
lead, and if anything is denser, it is reported.<br>
<h4><a name="Error_Tests"></a>
Error Tests</h4>
These tests should not return any rows. &nbsp;(A returned row indicates a
match for the sql query that is looking for errors.)<br>
If they do, they indicate a problem with the running of the servicing society.
<h3><a name="Run_Comparison"></a>
Run Comparison</h3>
 The datagrabber allows the user to compare any two runs or several runs
against a baseline. &nbsp;Once two runs have been chosen<br>
the user can "run diffs" of any or all of the Validation test categories.
&nbsp;Typically, since all the tests may take several minutes to run,<br>
just the core tests are used to determine if two runs are equivalent. &nbsp;If
any test detects a difference, that difference be selected and<br>
shown.<br>
<br>
The intent is to provide the assessor with the capability to sample data
for a baseline run and then do later experimental runs and <br>
compare the results with the baseline to determine if the experimental society
was disturbed or not.<br>
<h3></h3>
<h3><a name="Config_File"></a>
Config File</h3>
The datagrabber scripts in the bin directory require an xml configuration
file. &nbsp;This file specifies basic information about the<br>
database being used, the demand society PSPs, the servicing society PSPs,
the web server, <br>
the Completion PSP, and derived table generation.
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Web_Server_config"></a>
Web Server config</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The datagrabber web server configuration defines which
port the datagrabber will listen on and the refresh rate for<br>
pages that refresh automatically. The document root for associated html files
is also defined here.
<h4>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Completion_PSP"></a>
Completion PSP</h4>
</h4>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The datagrabber uses the Completion PSP to monitor when
the servicing society is done processing and ready to be sampled. &nbsp;This<br>
 information is presented on the Completion Assessor page. &nbsp;The host,
port, and psp name are all specified here.
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Database_config"></a>
Database config</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These values can be set in the cougaar.rc file as follows,
or set in the config xml file. &nbsp;If there are values in both, the <br>
config xml file values will override those in the cougaar.rc file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cougaar.rc entry is :<br>
<br>
# datagrabber database configuration <br>
org.cougaar.mlm.ui.grabber.config.DBConfig.connectionURL=jdbc:mysql://&lt;localhost&gt;/grabber
<br>
org.cougaar.mlm.ui.grabber.config.DBConfig.user=&lt;user&gt; <br>
org.cougaar.mlm.ui.grabber.config.DBConfig.password=&lt;password&gt;
<br>
org.cougaar.mlm.ui.grabber.config.DBConfig.syntax=MySQL<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If these values are in the cougaar.rc file, both the datagrabber
and the TPFDD Viewer will read them and automatically<br>
agree on which database to use.
<h4><a name="Demand_society"></a>
Demand society </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two demand society PSPs that are configured
in the config file : the Hierarchy and the Datagrabber PSPs.<br>
<h5><a name="Hierarchy_PSP"></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Hierarchy_PSP"></a>
Hierarchy PSP</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is an example entry for the Hierarchy PSP:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&lt;HierarchyPSP Society="Demand" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
VirtualRoot="HigherAuthority" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
VirtualRootName="Higher Authority"&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;Cluster&gt;CENTCOM-HHC&lt;/Cluster&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;URLConnection&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Host&gt;localhost&lt;/Host&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Port&gt;5555&lt;/Port&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ClusterName&gt;CENTCOM-HHC&lt;/ClusterName&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Package&gt;alpine/demo&lt;/Package&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;PspID&gt;NEW_HIERARCHY.PSP&lt;/PspID&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;UseXML&gt;Y&lt;/UseXML&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ThisFileInstead&gt;d:/datagrabber/bin/&lt;/ThisFileInstead&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;/URLConnection&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&lt;/HierarchyPSP&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There initial Society attribute defines which of the two
societies the hierarchy is being discovered for. &nbsp;The options are<br>
either Demand or TOPS (this is the servicing society). &nbsp;There may be
multiple roots in the demand society, each specified in<br>
a Cluster tag. &nbsp;All of these roots will be placed under the VirtualRoot,
here assigned the name "HigherAuthority". &nbsp;When<br>
this organization is displayed in the TPFDD Viewer, it's name will be specified
by the VirtualRootName attribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The URL connection defines the parts of the URL that needs
to be assembled to call the NEW_HIERARCHY PSP. &nbsp;In this<br>
case, the option to use XML is specified. &nbsp;Any PSP can be run in either
serialized or XML mode. &nbsp;The advantage of XML mode<br>
is if there are version number differences between the jars of the datagrabber
and the society, they can still be run together.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ThisFileInstead tag allows you to specify a file to
be read instead of an invocation of the PSP. &nbsp;In this case, the Hierarchy
PSP<br>
will look for a file called CENTCOM-HHC_Hierarchy.xml (each agent specified
in the Cluster tag, appended with the name of the PSP)<br>
in the d:/datagrabber/bin directory.<br>
<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Datagrabber_PSP"></a>
Datagrabber PSP</h5>
The datagrabber PSP entry defines where to begin running the first PSP to
run, the Datagrabber PSP. Machine, port, and PSP name<br>
are defined here.
<h4><a name="Derived_table_generation"></a>
Derived table generation</h4>
The datagrabber produces a set of derived tables, based on the results of
the PSPs that gather the raw data. &nbsp;These tables are<br>
in a form that allow speedier queries from the TPFDD Viewer. &nbsp;This section
specifies which tables to create. &nbsp;Although the derived<br>
tables make the TPFDD Viewer much faster, it adds to the amount of time required
for each datagrabber run.<br>
<h3><a name="A_Datagrabber_Run"></a>
A Datagrabber Run</h3>
The Datagrabber supports the concept of a "run" which is one sample of the
data contained in the agents to be<br>
 examined. &nbsp;An arbitrary number of runs can be stored in a database.
&nbsp;Associated with each run are a set of tables<br>
 that are the data that are collected.<br>
<h3><a name="Database_Support"></a>
Database Support</h3>
Currently only MySQL is fully supported, but there the use of an Oracle or
other database has been anticipcated<br>
and some movement toward support has been done in the code.
<h3><a name="Agent_Hierarchy"></a>
Agent Hierarchy</h3>
 The agent hierarchy of both the demand and servicing society can be discovered
dymanically (through the NEW_HIERARCHY<br>
 PSP) or taken from a static XML file. &nbsp;This XML file can come from
a direct invocation of the NEW_HIERARCHY PSP<br>
 from a browser. &nbsp;The config file can specify which behavior the datagrabber
does.
<h3><a name="Logger"></a>
Logger</h3>
  The logging facility logs information to the database, taged with its Time,
Severity, Type, Run context, Message, and Exception. &nbsp;<br>
The Severity has this range :&nbsp; [Fatal] [Error] [Warning] [Important]
[Normal] [Minor] [Trivial]. <br>
The Exception is filled in if there is a relevant exception associated with
the log.<br>
<h3><a name="Work_Queue_Engine"></a>
Work Queue Engine</h3>
The work queue engine supports the concept of a piece of work that needs
to be completed. &nbsp;Once completed, a piece of work <br>
can spawn new pieces of work, and so on, until a run (which is the highest
level piece of work) is complete. &nbsp;This engine is quite general<br>
and could be used in non-transportation or data gathering contexts.<br>
<br>
For every piece of work, a thread is recruited from a thread pool to service
the piece of work.<br>
<br>
Any piece of work can be aborted and a run cancelled.
<h3><a name="PSPs_Used"></a>
PSPs Used</h3>
There are a range of PSPs used to gather information about what types of
assets are being moved or allocated, and what types are handling the allocation.
&nbsp;These PSPs gather information about:<br>
<br>
Locations - determines a complete set of unique locations<br>
Convoys - discovers convoys in the servicing society<br>
Instance - finds asset instances of items being allocated<br>
Population - discovers the set of transportation/physical assets that can
satisfy requests<br>
Routes - the set of routes that instances can take<br>
Prototypes - cargo prototypes<br>
Legs - the individual legs that make up the journey a piece of cargo takes
to get to its destination<br>
