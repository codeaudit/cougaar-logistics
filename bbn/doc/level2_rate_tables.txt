Instructions for generating the data for the level 2 rate tables. Note 
that this data is derived from data already existing in the database.
This is done so that repeated queries will not have to be done at runtime.
However, this means that the data needs to be regenerated whenever the 
base data changes.

Step 1:

Generate the level_2_fuel_rate data by running level2fuel.sql in 
DB-Visualizer or another tool. 

Extract the results and save in the file level_2_fuel_rate_new.csv.


Step 2:

Generate the level_2_ammo_rate data by running level2ammo.sql in 
DB-Visualizer or another tool. 

Extract the results and save in the file level_2_ammo_rate_new.csv.


Step 3:

Generate the level_2_spares data by successively running level2spare_dcr.sql,
level2spare_weight.sql, and level2spare_cube.sql in DB-Visualizer or 
another tool. 

Extract the results, combine the data, and save in the file 
level_2_spares_new.csv.

A simple way to combine the data is to paste the data into Excel; copy 
all of the DCR columns, the agg_tons_per_day column from the weight data, and 
the agg_cubic_feet_per_day column from the cube data into another sheet;
and save that as CSV. Make sure the columns are formatted correctly.


Step 4:

Make sure the data records end with commas:

   lastcomma.pl level_2_fuel_rate_new.csv > level_2_fuel_rate_new2.csv
   lastcomma.pl level_2_ammo_rate_new.csv > level_2_ammo_rate_new2.csv
   lastcomma.pl level_2_spares_new.csv > level_2_spares_new2.csv

Make sure the data files are in Unix format instead of PC format. If you have been 
editing on a PC, you can load the files into Emacs, call 
'Meta-X set-buffer-file-coding-system', and enter 'unix' at the prompt.

Save the files as:

  level_2_fuel_rate.csv
  level_2_ammo_rate.csv
  level_2_spares.csv


Step 5:

Make sure the files are different from the current ones (using, for example,
diff). You can ignore any that are not.


Step 6:

Copy the updated files to appropriate place in your source tree (this was
dbms/data/csv at the time of writing).
