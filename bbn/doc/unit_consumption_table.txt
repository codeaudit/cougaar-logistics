Instructions for generating the data for the unit_consumption table. Note 
that this data is derived from data already existing in the database.
This is done so that repeated queries will not have to be done at runtime.
However, this means that the data needs to be regenerated whenever the 
base data changes.

Step 1:

Run the script get-unit-consumption.sql in DB-Visualizer or your favorite tool
to extract the data. Note that this may take a while.

Save the data as the file unit_consumption_new.csv.


Step 2: 

Make sure the data records end with commas:

   lastcomma.pl unit_consumption_new.csv  > unit_consumption_new2.csv

Make sure the data file is in Unix format instead of PC format. If you have been 
editing on a PC, you can load the file into Emacs, call 
'Meta-X set-buffer-file-coding-system', and enter 'unix' at the prompt.

Save the file as unit_consumption.csv.


Step 3:

Copy the file to appropriate place in your source tree (this was
dbms/data/csv at the time of writing).
