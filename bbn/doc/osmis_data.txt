Instructions for processing the OSMIS data provided by SRA.

This contains data for the header table and the army_spares_dc_by_optempo table.


Step 1:

Obtain the OSMIS data processed by SRA:

  osmis.sql

Note that this data is in a SQL script file and that data is provided 
for only a few items.


Step 2:

Process the header data:

Step 2a: 

Extract the header data and put into a temporary CSV files in the 
format of the header.csv file (located at dbms\data\csv at the time of 
this writing). Since there was so little data, it was fastest to do this 
manually. If more data becomes available, it would be a good idea to 
write a Perl script to do this.

Save the data as osmis_header_raw.csv.


Step 2b:

Obtain a copy of the FED LOG CDs and look-up data missing from the header 
records. Fill in the these values in the header file. For example, you
should be able to find AAC, price, and ICC.


Step 2c:

Add the contents of osmis_header.csv to the end of header.csv. Check to see if 
there are any duplicate records (same NSN). If so, if there are any fields 
with NULL values in the new data with values in the old data, copy the old 
values over. Then, remove the old record.

Save this as header_new.csv.


Step 2d:

Make sure the data records end with commas:

   lastcomma.pl header_new.csv  > header_new2.csv

Make sure the data file is in Unix format instead of PC format. If you have been 
editing on a PC, you can load the file into Emacs, call 
'Meta-X set-buffer-file-coding-system', and enter 'unix' at the prompt.

Save the file as header.csv and put it in the appropriate place (dbms\data\csv 
at the time of this writing).


Step 3:

Process the army_spares_dc_by_optempo (asdbo) data:


Step 3a: 

Extract the 'insert' records from the asdbo data and save as osmis_asdbo.sql.


Step 3b:

Obtain a copy of the current asdbo data. This is in the army_spares.ZIP file
(located at dbms\data\mysql at the time of this writing); extract it to get 
army.txt.


Step 3c: 

Make sure the asdbo records are using the same format as those in army.txt. 
If not, edit them to match.  Since there was so little data, it was fastest 
to do this manually. If more data becomes available, it would be a good 
idea to write a Perl script to do this.


Step 3d:

Add the contents of osmis_asdbo.sql to army.txt. Check to see if 
there are any duplicate records (same class 9 and class 7 NSNs). If so, 
remove the old ones.

Save this as army_new.txt.


Step 3e:

Make sure the data file is in Unix format instead of PC format. If you have been 
editing on a PC, you can load the file into Emacs, call 
'Meta-X set-buffer-file-coding-system', and enter 'unix' at the prompt.

Save the file as army.txt.


Step 3f:

Zip the file army.txt into the file army_spares.ZIP and put it in the 
appropriate place (dbms\data\mysql at the time of this writing).
