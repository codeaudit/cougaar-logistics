Instructions for creating the ammo_characteristics table from the Gorman-Braddock data.

Step 1:

Obtain the source file from the Gorman-Braddock study:

  ammo_characteristics.2.csv

This contains the updated data. The commas and quotation marks in the nomenclature
field have been replaced by colons and "-IN".

Load the data into a data editor (such as Excel or Emacs).


Step 2:

Extract the data from the current ammo_characteristics table in the database
(using DB-Visualizer or your favorite tool) and load into the data editor.


Step 3:

Replace the commas in the current data with colons.


Step 4: 

Check the current data for any items not present in the new data.
Manually add these to the new data. For example, the following items
were found at the time this document was written:

  H116   2.75IN SMOKE M259   34.5   MBB
  H183   2.75IN M257 ILLUM   44.3   MBB
  T943   120MM STAFF         72     MBB

Save the combined data as ammo_characteristics_new_raw.csv.


Step 5:

Check for (using sort or a similar utility)and manually remove duplicate 
dodic records, keeping the one for each dodic that contains the most info 
in the nomenclature field (or that contains the most standard-looking text).

Save the edited data as ammo_characteristics_new.csv. You can check for 
remaining duplicates and mistakenly deleted items using sort and diff.

Notes:

    A059 -> M855 seems to be standard (www.fas.org)
    A063 -> M856


Step 6: 

Make sure the data records end with commas:

   lastcomma.pl ammo_characteristics_new.csv  > ammo_characteristics_new2.csv

Make sure the data file is in Unix format instead of PC format. If you have been 
editing on a PC, you can load the file into Emacs, call 
'Meta-X set-buffer-file-coding-system', and enter 'unix' at the prompt.

Save the file as ammo_characteristics.csv.


Step 7:

Copy the file to appropriate place in your source tree (this was
dbms/data/csv at the time of writing).
