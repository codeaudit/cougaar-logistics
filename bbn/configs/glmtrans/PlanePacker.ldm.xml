  <!-- Note that the name of the prototype is the same as the type 
       identification for that prototype, so we have that unreadable 
       NSN number.  

       This is only by convention and in fact the name of the prototype 
       could be some nice English phrase like "5_ton_truck" which is easy 
       to debug.

       However we were instructed by ALP to use the NSN number for this 
       example to get the library accepted in the ALP contrib directory.

       To make things worse, the IBM parser does not allow the '/' 
       character in XML atributes of Type ID.  This means that we had
       to give the prototypes name like "NSN-####" instead of "NSN/###".
